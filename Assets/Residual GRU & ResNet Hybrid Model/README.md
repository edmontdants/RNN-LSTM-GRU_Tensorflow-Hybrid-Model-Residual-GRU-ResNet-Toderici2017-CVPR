Model Final Results<br>
Reconstructed(Decoded) Representatinos in PNG & JPEG Formats in all quality levels from 0 to 15

each '32*32*3' input image is reduced to a 2*2*32 binarized representation per iteration. This results in each iteration representing 1=8 bit per pixel (bpp).
If only the first iteration is used, this would be 192:1 compression, even before entropy coding
